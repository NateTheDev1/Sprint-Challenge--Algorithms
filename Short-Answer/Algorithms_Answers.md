#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), a will continue to grow until it satisfies the conditions of n _ n _ n

b) O(n^2), a nested loop

c) O(n), recursively called until conditions of n bunnies is met, it also could stop immediately and start at 0, or eventually become 0

## Exercise II

Well for 1, I would

floorsChecked = []

minFloor = 0

in floor in range of f
drop and egg,
if egg is broken
minFloor - 1
else if egg is not broken
minFloor + 1

return minFloor

I would have this loop going from 0 until f, the minFloor will return the max floor they could drop from
